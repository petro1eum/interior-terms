# Interior Terms Matrix

## The Problem

In the interior design world, there's a constant headache: nobody fucking knows who's responsible for what. This leads to:
- Endless disputes between designers and clients
- Blown budgets due to "unexpected" work
- Missed deadlines because "we thought you were doing that"
- Ruined relationships and legal battles
- Mental breakdowns for everyone involved

## What This Tool Does

Imagine a matrix where one axis shows all project stages and the other shows all types of work. Each cell clearly indicates:
- Who's specifically responsible (Designer or Client)
- What's included in the scope
- What's explicitly NOT included
- What risks might pop up
- How long it typically takes
